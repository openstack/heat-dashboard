  - |
    The default configuration file has been updated and now includes
    the required parameters to use the new policy-in-code feature in Horizon.
    Because of this change, the defualt policy.json is no longer included in
    this repo but replaced with policy.yaml. Please refer to the release note
    and documentation of Horizon to find details about this feature.
